Additionally, mango butter's natural antioxidant content and high levels of beneficial fatty acids, including oleic acid, make it an appealing ingredient for health-conscious consumers. It is particularly valued in the production of dairy-free, vegan, and gluten-free products, catering to the growing demand for plant-based and allergen-friendly food options.<p>In the food industry, mango butter is also used in the manufacturing of energy bars, spreads, and sauces. As consumers increasingly look for healthier, more sustainable alternatives to traditional food ingredients, the demand for plant-based butters, such as mango butter, is expected to rise. Moreover, the growing focus on clean-label products, which emphasize simple and recognizable ingredients, has enhanced mango butter’s appeal in the food sector.
