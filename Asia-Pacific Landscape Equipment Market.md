IoT-enabled equipment is helping businesses improve efficiency, reduce labor costs, and optimize the management of outdoor spaces.</p><p>Another significant trend is the growing emphasis on sustainability. Both residential and commercial sectors are looking for ways to reduce their environmental impact, leading to a surge in demand for eco-friendly and energy-efficient landscape equipment. Battery-powered equipment, solar-powered tools, and electric lawnmowers are gaining popularity as consumers and businesses seek greener alternatives.
